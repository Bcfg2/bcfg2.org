We are happy to announce the release of Bcfg2 1.3.3. It is available
for download at:

 ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg

This release fixes a great number of bugs in 1.3.2, but it also comes
with many fun and exciting new features. Please read the release notes
thoroughly.

The following user-facing change is included:

 * The when attribute of Action tags is now honored even with timing
   set to "pre" or "both".

The following is a non-exhaustive list of new features and bug fixes:

* New AWSTags plugin sets groups and supplies data from AWS tag data:
  http://docs.bcfg2.org/server/plugins/connectors/awstags.html
* Completely rewritten (and deduplicated) spec file for building RPMs
* Completely rewritten bcfg2-crypt, which adds some features to allow
  decrypting Cfg files and encrypting/decrypting Properties files without
  specifying passphrases on the command line.
* Multiprocessing core now actually works
* Handle high-latency reporting database connections better
* Timeout incomplete XML-RPC calls correctly and avoid stray threads.
* Ensure that XIncluded Bundler and Properties files are monitored
  for changes

* SSH key generation generation fixes:

  * More complete way to specify authorized_keys options
  * Fixed setting category specificity for authorized_keys
  * Properly generate public keys from private keys

* Connector plugins can now create new groups and set options on them
* Properly remove ACLs from managed files
* POSIX improvements to help running as non-root (e.g., bcfg2-info builddir)

* Fixes to clients.xml writing:

  * Reread clients.xml on every write. This could reduce performance if
    clients.xml is frequently updated, but also resolves a race condition
    where a new client may fail to declare its version or assert its
    profile.
  * Reduce number of clients.xml writes due to gratuitous profile
    assertions.

* Chkconfig bugs fixed

  * List all services correctly
  * Let chkconfig assign default runlevels according to the init script

* Fixed return value from bcfg2-test
* Use fam_blocking option in all commands that start a server (bcfg2-info,
  bcfg2-test, etc.)
* Reduce noise from encryption failures with decrypt=lax
* POSIXUsers driver works better with older usermod

* bcfg2-yum-helper improvements:

  * Much much better (and far less error-prone) yum caching
  * Added timeout to fix hanging yum problem

* bcfg2-info fixes:

  * Fixed automatch behavior
  * Added expirecache command to expire metadata cache

* Fixed inconsistent initial metadata group ordering and searching,
  which could result in inconsistent category suppression
* SELinux properly looks up the default context in all cases
* Several performance improvements, particularly on startup
* Better packages caching
* Various logging improvements
* Various error handling improvements
* Various Debian/Ubuntu build fixes
* Various bcfg2-admin viz fixes and improvements
* Various UTF-8/unicode fixes
